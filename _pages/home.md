We study systems that involve a 'human component'. We try to find the right tools to understand social systems on various scales â€“ from minimal model systems showing collective behavior to societal transformations.

Methodologies include:

- computer simulations
- analytical theory
- statistical physics
- network science
- game theory

Topics include:

- sustainable mobility
- social networks
- theory of change (institutions, values, ...)
- emergence of cooperation
- economics & finance (e.g. sharing economy, growth paradigm)
