This newly established group studies systems that involve a 'human component'. We try to find 'the right' tools to understand social systems on various scales â€“ from minimal model systems showing collective behavior (e.g. emergence of cooperation) to societal transformations (e.g. towards sustainable mobility).

Methodologies include:

- computer simulations (e.g. agent-based)
- analytical theory
- statistical physics
- network science
- game theory

Topics include:

- sustainable mobility
- theory of change (institutions, values, ...)
- economics & finance (e.g. sharing economy, growth paradigm)
